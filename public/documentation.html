        <p>This web API application will provide users with access to information about different
            movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
            personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.</p>
        
        <p>For example to register a new user, this can be done using postman. Download postman <a
                href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/" target="_blank">Here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>Using the post method in postman, follow the picture below by adding neccessary data to complete the request and hit enter on your keyboard.
        After registration is completed, users needs to log in using the /login endpoint, where they would be issued with an 
        authorization token. With this token, users have access to all other endpoints as shown in the table below.
